The patient has a complex medical condition with a history of heart disease, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and is currently experiencing respiratory failure, sepsis, and acute kidney injury. The decision-maker expressed concerns about the patient's quality of life, burden of treatment, and alignment with patient's values. The patient's wishes were discussed, and it was determined that he would like to pursue aggressive medical therapies as long as they align with his values and do not compromise his quality of life. The decision-maker was informed of the possibility of hospice care, palliative care, and do-not-resuscitate order, and expressed a desire to explore these options further. The patient's advance directive was reviewed, and it was noted that he has not completed a POLST form. The decision-maker was provided with information on the importance of advance care planning and the role of a healthcare proxy. The patient's care plan will be updated to reflect his wishes and values, and the decision-maker will be supported throughout the decision-making process. Total time spent face-to-face with patient's decision-maker providing counseling related to advance care planning: 30 minutes.\""
